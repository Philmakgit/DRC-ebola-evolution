# The outbreak situation of the Ebola Virus 

<p>This simple project demostrates the utility of data science. I chose personally
to study the evolution of the ebola outbreak that has been occurring in the north-east of the DRC since August 2018.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many people have lost their lives.
I really encourage all those who are willing to provide their efforts day and night to
stop this outbreak. And for all those who want to know whether or not the danger is growing up, this can be your quick reference.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href='https://twitter.com/OlyIlunga'>Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga</a>, <i>ex DRC's Minister of Health</i>, for making available the data of this outbreak.
The data I'am using here, comes from this website https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ebola-cases-and-deaths-drc-north-kivu
and the sources are added daily on https://mailchi.mp/sante.gouv.cd/ </p>
<p>My last update here is 2019-11-04.</p>
<p>This source code is free of any improvements or even suggestions for improvement.
For anyone who can contribute, I will be really happy.</p>

# MY QUESTIONS
<p>I will try to answer four questions</p>

<p>

### FIRST QUESTION
Do you want to see what were the daily situation of health areas
in terms of confirmed cases and confirmed death?</p>
<p>

### SECOND QUESTION
Do you want to see the number of people with Ebola per provinve per month, confirmed by the laboratory?
</p>
<p>

### THIRD QUESTION
What is the proportion of confirmed deaths compared to confirmed cases?</p>
<p>

### FOURTH QUESTION
Is there a way to customize the data?
</p>
